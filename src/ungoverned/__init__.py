# ⚠️  UNGOVERNED NAMESPACE — QUARANTINE ZONE  ⚠️
# =============================================================================
# Code in this namespace was generated under Article 50 (Martial Governance).
# It has NOT passed constitutional review by the agent Senate.
#
# ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║  WARNING: IMPORTING FROM THIS NAMESPACE INTO GOVERNED CODE IS FORBIDDEN  ║
# ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# MECHANICAL ENFORCEMENT:
#   - Build-time scanner will FAIL on governed → ungoverned imports
#   - CI pipeline blocks merges with quarantine violations
#   - All artifacts carry UNGOVERNED watermark in metadata
#
# LIABILITY:
#   - Code here is signed with KEEPER liability
#   - No warranty, no governance, no constitutional protection
#   - Use at your own risk
#
# TO EXIT QUARANTINE:
#   - Code must be submitted for full Senate review
#   - Upon AUTHORIZATION, code moves to src/governed/
#   - Original UNGOVERNED signature is preserved in audit log
