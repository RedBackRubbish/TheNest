## To Exit Quarantine

Code in this namespace can be "rehabilitated" through:

1. **Submit for Review**: Request Senate deliberation on the code
2. **Pass Governance**: All agents must vote AUTHORIZE
3. **Move to Governed**: Upon approval, code moves to `src/governed/`
4. **Preserve Audit**: Original UNGOVERNED signature remains in Chronicle

---

## Files in Quarantine

Any `.py` files in this directory (excluding `__init__.py`) are quarantined artifacts.

They carry the following watermark in metadata:

```python
{
    "zone": "UNGOVERNED",
    "article": "Article 50: Martial Governance",
    "liability": "KEEPER",
    "constitutional_protection": False,
    "senate_reviewed": False
}
```

---

## Why This Exists

**Martial Governance must be mechanically painful, not symbolic.**

This quarantine ensures that bypassing the Senate comes with real friction:
- Code cannot be easily integrated
- Build systems reject violations
- Every artifact is watermarked with liability

If using Martial Law feels inconvenient, *that's the point*.
